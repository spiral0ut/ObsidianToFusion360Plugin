# Fusion 360 Params Sync (No-Build Version) â€” Fixed

Fixes:
- Recognizes `params:` with no value (indented list underneath).
- Supports units with *or without* a space, e.g. `35deg` or `33 in`.
- Shows how many parameters were exported.

## Install
Copy **fusion-params-sync** to `<YourVault>/.obsidian/plugins/fusion-params-sync/`, restart Obsidian, enable.
